i just learned to use "mysql" and do basic datbase interactions so i decided to create a password-system 
in python with "mysql" i set the database to localhost but if you want to you can always open a port
and then host your database so others can use it. The exe file is just a showcase of the program
but you can always add your own stuff in the "login.py" file, remember to only use that file.

- VERSION 1.0.0

QUICK NOTE - you have to create your own database with a table called "users" and 2 columns 1st being "username", 2nd being "password"
P.S: if this doesnt work then its a problem on your behalf i tested everything multiple times on 2 different pcs.
